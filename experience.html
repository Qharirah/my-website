                My new experience as a student in Uitm Kedah is that I joined SUKSIS, which is a voluntary police force as part of my extracurricular activities. Many benefits I gained from SUKSIS, such as learning new knowledge and becoming more disciplined. Additionally, we need to stay healthy and fit in SUKSIS because we use both physical and mental strength in our activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also made many new friends after joining SUKSIS. We do many interesting activities together. We often can't go back home during semester breaks because we have activities, so we stay in college for one or two weeks.

                I also made new friends since I started my Diploma in Uitm Kedah. There are Ain Assyifa and Azwanie Affnieydda. I usually hang out and have lunch together with them. We sometimes work on assignments together. They help me whenever I face difficulties with assignments, and I am very thankful to have them.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we have free time, we go out to places like Amanjaya Mall to eat and shop. They are great listeners when I share my stories.
